# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### 🐛 Fixes

* **🛠️ Corrupted tool-call arguments left no durable evidence**: A buffered streaming tool call with invalid JSON arguments produced only a warn-level line in an output channel VS Code rotates at a small cap, and the malformed-args skips in the end-of-stream recovery flush logged to the plain channel only, so the evidence needed to diagnose silently dropped tool calls was already erased by the time anyone looked. Every invalid-arguments detection point (finish gate, recovery flush, VS Code part emission fallback) now logs an error-level structured event with the argument length and a 160-character preview, and the "LiteLLM Structured" channel is mirrored to daily JSONL files in extension global storage with 14-day retention. Opt out with `litellm-connector.debug.structuredLogFile.enabled`. Tool-call emission behavior is unchanged. (`src/adapters/streaming/liteLLMStreamInterpreter.ts`, `src/adapters/streaming/vscodePartEmitter.ts`, `src/observability/structuredLogger.ts`, `src/observability/structuredLogFileSink.ts`)

### 🧪 Tests

* Regression coverage that invalid buffered arguments produce error-level structured events at the finish gate, in the recovery flush, and at the emission fallback, while the previous emit-or-drop behavior is preserved. (`src/adapters/streaming/test/`)

## [2.1.9] - 2026-07-09

### 🐛 Fixes

* **🛠️ Capability-aware `tool_choice` filtering (bug [#114](https://github.com/gethnet/litellm-connector-copilot/issues/114))**: Tool-enabled requests now omit the `tool_choice` parameter when LiteLLM's `supported_openai_params` metadata explicitly does not list it. Models with explicit support continue to receive `tool_choice: "auto"` for automatic tool selection, while models without capability metadata retain the previous compatibility behavior. This prevents Azure GPT-5.6 and similar deployments from rejecting requests because of an unsupported parameter. (`src/utils.ts`, `src/providers/base/requestBuilder.ts`, `src/providers/liteLLMProviderBase.ts`)

### 🧪 Tests

* Added regression coverage for `tool_choice` capability detection, request construction, unsupported-parameter filtering, and automatic-mode behavior. (`src/providers/test/parameterValidation.test.ts`, `src/providers/test/liteLLMProviderBase.requestBuilder.test.ts`, `src/providers/test/liteLLMProviderBase.test.ts`, `src/utils/test/utils.test.ts`)

## [2.1.8] - 2026-07-04

### 🚀 Features

* **💰 Model pricing display in picker**: Added support for displaying LiteLLM model pricing in the VS Code model picker using the official VS Code proposed API (`inputCost`, `outputCost`, `cacheCost`, `cacheWriteCost`, `priceCategory`). Pricing is extracted from LiteLLM's `/model/info` endpoint and surfaced as "credits per million tokens" with category badges ("Low cost", "Medium cost", "High cost", "Very high cost").
* **📊 Per-request cost tracking**: Added cost calculation to the streaming token capture pipeline. Estimated costs (input, output, total) are computed from token counts × per-token pricing and attached to usage DataParts for telemetry. Cost fields are also reported through the telemetry service's lifecycle events.
* **🔧 Display pricing toggle**: Added `displayPricingInPicker` workspace setting to control whether pricing is shown in the model picker (default: `true`).
* **🩹 Stabilize model discovery**: Added discovery response caching (`discoveryCacheTtlMs`), explicit request timeouts (`discoveryTimeoutMs`), and debounced change notifications (`discoveryFireDebounceMs`, `discoveryFireMinIntervalMs`) to prevent VS Code from re-querying `/model/info` too frequently and causing avoidable proxy traffic and extension-host churn. Hash-based cache keys isolate requests by backend URL + API key suffix.

### 🛠️ Fixed
- `allowChatCompletionsFallback` now actually falls back from `/responses` to `/chat/completions` on 5xx (previously documented but unimplemented — triggered by a user 500 error on `azure_ai/gpt-5.4-mini`)
- `disableCaching` now reaches the HTTP client on the request hot path and the `countTokens` path (previously read but never threaded into `LiteLLMClient`; default `true` is now effective)
- Removed `litellm-connector.sendDefaultParameters` setting and its consumer (honors the v1.5.0 deprecation; the setting was broken-from-birth — never read by `getConfig()` — and was explicitly marked "temporary, will be removed in a future version. Defaults will be omitted by default." Defaults are now omitted by default as documented)
- `LiteLLM: Set Log Level` command now declared in `package.json` and registered in `extension.ts` (previously orphaned handler)
- Removed dead config fields from `LiteLLMConfig`: `inlineCompletionsEnabled`, `inlineCompletionsModelId`, `inlineCompletionsMaxContextTokens`, `v2ApiEnabled`, `enableResponses`, and dead plumbing for `modelOverrides`/`enableModelOverrides` (the underlying workspace SETTINGS stay live; only the unused config-object fields are removed)
- Removed dead `litellm-connector.enableResponsesApi` setting from `package.json` (zero consumers — `/responses` routing is controlled by `forceResponsesEndpoint` and per-model proxy `mode` advertisement, not this setting)
- Fixed `enableModelOverrides` `package.json` default (`false` → `true`) to match the runtime default
- Telemetry no longer reports `inline-completions`/`responses-api` config toggles (the underlying fields gated no behavior)

### 📚 Docs
- Corrected `AGENTS.md` completions-provider-registration claim to match reality (no `LanguageModelTextCompletionProvider` is registered; inline completions served via VS Code native model-tag routing)
- Corrected `README.marketplace.md` "Image and PDF analysis" claim to "Image analysis support"
- Removed stale `enableResponsesApi` rows from `README.md` and `README.marketplace.md` setting tables
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to document the cost tracking pipeline architecture

### 🧪 Tests

* **Pricing calculator**: Added comprehensive test suite covering extraction from model info (including scientific notation and IEEE 754 artifact handling), formatting for detail and tooltip, and cost calculation with cache read/creation token accounting.
* **Provider registry pricing**: Added integration tests verifying pricing fields are correctly propagated to `LanguageModelChatInformation` via the official proposed API.
* **Stream token capture cost**: Added tests for cost calculation in the token snapshot, verifying estimated costs are correctly attached to usage DataParts.

### 🧹 Chores

* **🆕 New utils: pricingCalculator**: Extracted pricing logic into a reusable utility module with pure functions for extraction, formatting, and calculation.
* **📦 Created proposed API types**: Added `src/vscode.proposed.languageModelPricing.d.ts` to define the VS Code proposed API for pricing fields.

## [2.1.7] - 2026-06-24

### 🐛 Fixes

* **🛡️ Stop redacting `insert_edit_into_file` on the first turn of every session (bug [#106](https://github.com/gethnet/litellm-connector-copilot/issues/106))**: Quota detection now only redacts on **high-confidence** matches — a real `LanguageModelToolResultPart` whose `callId` resolves to a redactable tool name. The previous regex-pair detector matched Copilot's own `<reminderInstructions>` scaffolding (which describes quota handling as guidance to the model) and stripped file-edit tools on every turn, even when no actual quota error had occurred. A low-confidence branch still logs a DEBUG trace and **does not** mutate the request or emit a fake `quota_exceeded:<tool>` failure event into telemetry, eliminating the noisy PostHog signal. (`src/providers/liteLLMProviderBase.ts`, `src/providers/base/requestBuilder.ts`, `src/providers/base/types.ts`)

### 🧪 Tests

* **High-confidence redaction coverage**: Updated the redaction tests to cover high-confidence `LanguageModelToolResultPart` matches, wrapper-only false positives (`<reminderInstructions>`-style echoed text), and non-redactable tool results. The detector is now verified to leave the tool list alone when only prompt scaffolding references the tool name. (`src/providers/test/liteLLMProviderBase.test.ts`)
* **Request builder fixtures**: Adjusted request builder test fixtures for the new confidence field on the redaction result so the pipeline stays deterministic. (`src/providers/test/liteLLMProviderBase.requestBuilder.test.ts`)

### 🧹 Chores

* **📦 Version bump to `2.1.7`**: Promoted the package from `2.1.6` to `2.1.7` to ship the redaction fix. (`package.json`)

## [2.1.6] - 2026-06-21

### 🐛 Fixes

* **🔧 String `category` on registered models (bug [#104](https://github.com/gethnet/litellm-connector-copilot/issues/104))**: `LanguageModelChatInformation.category` is now always a string (`'lightweight' | 'versatile' | 'powerful' | undefined`) emitted by the LiteLLM provider registry. Previously the registry set only the grouping object, which crashes VS Code's chat model picker (`getCategoryLabel`) with `TypeError: a.charAt is not a function` when its `default:` switch branch tries to call `.charAt` on the non-string value. With Copilot quota exhausted and BYOK models as the only viable option, this crash aborted `buildModelPickerItems()` and prevented the dropdown from ever opening. Per-backend picker section grouping is now driven by the existing vendor / id lookup rather than the `category` slot, so the picker continues to bucket models by backend. This is a workaround; the proper fix remains upstream in `microsoft/vscode` (add a `typeof === 'string'` guard in `getCategoryLabel`'s `default:` branch). (`src/providers/liteLLMProviderRegistry.ts`)
* **🧠 Picker category derivation from capabilities**: Added `derivePickerCategory()` to map a model's derived capabilities to one of VS Code's three supported tags. `powerful` when reasoning is supported or the context window is ≥ 200k tokens, `versatile` when tools or vision are supported, `lightweight` for small-context models without tools/vision/reasoning, and `undefined` (never `null`, never an object) when no signal is conclusive. Decision order is `powerful` > `versatile` > `lightweight` > `undefined`. The helper is pure, deterministic, and has no I/O. (`src/utils/modelCapabilities.ts`)

### 🧪 Tests

* **`derivePickerCategory` branch coverage**: Added 6 unit tests covering each tier (lightweight / versatile / powerful / undefined), the large-context-window short-circuit, and a regression guard that the helper never returns `null` or a non-string value. (`src/utils/test/modelCapabilities.test.ts`)
* **Registry `category` integration tests**: Added 4 integration tests asserting the registry emits `'versatile'` for balanced tools+vision models, `'powerful'` for reasoning-capable models, `'lightweight'` for small non-tooling models, and filters out the `'unknown model_name'` fallback so it never reaches VS Code. The existing per-backend grouping test continues to pass — we did not touch the grouping object. (`src/providers/test/liteLLMProviderBase.modelDisplay.test.ts`)

### 🧹 Chores

* **📦 `npm run check` script + version bump to `2.1.6`**: Added a top-level `check` script that chains lint, format, and coverage tests, giving a single command to validate the full pre-release gate. Bumped `package.json` to `2.1.6`. (`package.json`)
* **🧼 Workspace metadata cleanup**: Removed the unused DeepWiki MCP server entry from `.vscode/mcp.json` and refreshed the investigative agent's tool list to match the current dev container. This keeps workspace metadata aligned with the actual setup. (`.vscode/mcp.json`, `.github/agents/investigative agent.agent.md`)

## [2.1.5] - 2026-06-17

### 🐛 Fixes

* **🔧 forceResponsesEndpoint default corrected to opt-in (bug [#102](https://github.com/gethnet/litellm-connector-copilot/issues/102))**: The hidden configuration flag `litellm-connector.forceResponsesEndpoint` now defaults to `false`, requiring explicit user opt-in. Previously, this flag was introduced in v2.1.0 with an unintended `true` default, causing all models to route through the `/responses` endpoint when `enableResponsesApi` was enabled — even without the user explicitly setting the flag. Hidden config flags should follow the principle of least surprise; they must not change default routing behavior unless explicitly enabled. (`src/config/configManager.ts`)

### 📚 Documentation

* **🧾 Updated JSDoc for forceResponsesEndpoint**: Clarified that the flag is opt-in, JSON-only, and not exposed in the Settings UI. (`src/types.ts`)

## [2.1.4] - 2026-06-17

### 🐛 Fixes

* **🔧 Bedrock tool result formatting validation (bug [#100](https://github.com/gethnet/litellm-connector-copilot/issues/100))**: Added strict validation and diagnostic logging for tool result message format to ensure compatibility with Bedrock's Converse API. Tool result IDs are now validated to contain only alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores, and content is verified to be non-empty. When a tool result message fails format validation, diagnostic warnings are logged to aid troubleshooting without blocking the request. This prevents `BedrockException: Expected toolResult blocks` errors when using Bedrock backends with multi-turn conversations involving tool calls. (`src/adapters/messageConverter.ts`)

### 🧪 Tests

* **Tool result ID preservation and Bedrock compatibility**: Added comprehensive test suite validating tool result message format compliance, including ID normalization, message ordering, format validation for Bedrock-compatible character patterns, sequential tool call/result pairs, and content defaulting to "Success" for empty results. (`src/adapters/test/messageConverter.test.ts`)

## [2.1.3] - 2026-06-16

### 🐛 Fixes

* **🖼️ Image content serialization in `/responses` requests (bug [#98](https://github.com/gethnet/litellm-connector-copilot/issues/98))**: `image_url` content items in user and assistant messages are now correctly wrapped in an array before being sent to the `/responses` endpoint. Previously they were passed as a bare object, causing Azure (and other strict backends) to reject requests with `Invalid type for 'input[N].content': expected one of an array of objects or string, but got an object instead`. This failure was most visible in `inline-edit` sessions that include editor screenshots alongside a large conversation context. (`src/adapters/responsesAdapter.ts`)
* **⚡ Incomplete stream recovery**: The provider now attempts a best-effort recovery when a stream ends without a `[DONE]` marker. Buffered `/responses`-format tool calls, anonymous tool calls, and OpenAI tool calls are flushed and emitted rather than silently dropped. A partial response is returned to VS Code instead of hard-failing. (`src/providers/liteLLMChatProvider.ts`, `src/adapters/streaming/liteLLMStreamInterpreter.ts`)
* **🔇 Clean SSE closure handling**: SSE streams that close cleanly without buffered data are no longer treated as errors. Only genuinely truncated streams (data remains in the buffer) raise an error, producing clearer diagnostics for long-running proxy responses. (`src/adapters/sse/sseDecoder.ts`)

### 🧪 Tests

* **Regression coverage for bug #98**: Added an end-to-end inline-edit scenario test that builds a multi-turn conversation containing image content, tool invocations, and `reasoning_effort`, and asserts that no `message`-type input item produced by the adapter carries bare-object `content`. (`src/adapters/test/responsesAdapter.test.ts`)
* **Buffered tool call recovery**: Added unit tests for `flushPendingBuffers()` covering `/responses`-format, anonymous, and OpenAI tool call flushing on incomplete streams, malformed arg recovery, and empty buffer handling. (`src/adapters/streaming/test/liteLLMStreamInterpreter.test.ts`)
* **SSE clean closure / truncation detection**: Added regression tests for clean no-`[DONE]` termination (no error) and truncated buffer detection (explicit error). (`src/adapters/sse/test/sseDecoder.test.ts`)
* **Provider-level incomplete stream recovery**: Added chat provider tests verifying best-effort recovery is attempted on stream-end errors and that previously buffered tool calls are emitted to VS Code. (`src/providers/test/chatProvider.test.ts`)

## [2.1.2] - 2026-06-16

### ✨ Features

* **🖼️ Multimodal Content Preservation**: The `/responses` adapter now preserves `image_url` items when converting user and assistant chat messages, allowing multimodal prompts to pass through instead of dropping image content. System messages with content arrays are now supported by joining text items into request instructions. (`src/adapters/responsesAdapter.ts`, `src/types.ts`)

### 🚀 Performance & Memory

* **🧼 LRU Token Cache**: Replaced unbounded token count cache with LRU (Least Recently Used) cache capped at 100 entries. Reduces collection growth by **96%** (2,500 → 100 entries per 500 turns). (`src/utils/lruCache.ts`)
* **🧼 Bounded Audit Trail**: Added FIFO eviction to audit trail events, capping at 50 entries maximum. Reduces audit event accumulation by **97.5%** (2,000 → 50 entries per 500 turns). (`src/observability/auditTrail.ts`)
* **🧼 Orphan Request Timeout**: Added 5-second orphan timeout guard in token counting promises to clean up stuck pending requests. Reduces pending request count by **33%** (~1,500 → ~1,017 entries per 500 turns). (`src/providers/liteLLMProviderBase.ts`)
* **🧼 Lifecycle Cleanup**: Extension now calls `clearSessionCaches()` on deactivation to reset caches on reload, ensuring clean session starts. (`src/extension.ts`)
* **📊 Collective Impact**: All 4 memory fixes reduce total collection accumulation by **80.5%** (6,000 → ~1,167 entries per 500 turns) and cap long-session memory growth to **~14-15 MB** even at 1000+ turns (vs **21+ MB** unbounded). Stabilizes agentic sessions 500+ turns without GC pauses or hangs.

### 🐛 Fixes

* **SSE stream incomplete-response handling**: SSE streams that close without a `[DONE]` marker now throw an explicit error instead of silently completing with zero response parts. This prevents the retry loop and surfaces incomplete responses clearly to VS Code. Affects `/chat/completions` and `/responses` endpoints. (`src/adapters/sse/sseDecoder.ts`, `src/providers/liteLLMChatProvider.ts`)
* **Text array content parsing in responses adapter**: Now correctly reads `content[].text` only from `{ type: "text" }` items when building response instructions, preventing non-text payloads from being misparsed. (`src/adapters/responsesAdapter.ts`)
* **Chat request failure diagnostics**: Improved error logging to include full chat request error details (name, message, stack, root cause, caller, and stage), making failures easier to diagnose. Unified telemetry event from `request.fetch_failed` to `request.failed` for more complete context. (`src/providers/liteLLMChatProvider.ts`)

### 🧪 Tests

* Added `LRUCache` utility with 8 comprehensive unit tests covering eviction, access ordering, and edge cases. (`src/utils/test/lruCache.test.ts`)
* Added new audit trail test for bounded entries enforcement and FIFO eviction correctness. (`src/observability/test/auditTrail.test.ts`)
* Enhanced memory profile integration test to simulate all 5 bounded collection phases with realistic 500-turn load. (`src/test/integration/memoryProfile.test.ts`)
* Added unit coverage for user and assistant image content preservation in responses adapter. (`src/adapters/test/responsesAdapter.test.ts`)
* Added comprehensive integration coverage for the mock backend across lifecycle, endpoints, streaming, tool calls, latency, errors, and concurrent requests. Hardened cancellation coverage to verify immediate aborts before `fetch` is called. (`src/test/integration/mockLiteLLMBackend.test.ts`, `src/test/integration/cancellation.test.ts`)

### 🧹 Chores

* Downgraded heuristic tokenizer logs from debug to trace verbosity so token counting stays available without cluttering normal debug output. (`src/adapters/tokenizers/heuristicTokenizer.ts`)

## [2.1.1] - 2026-06-12

### 🐛 Fixes

* **Reasoning effort parameter gating**: Models that advertise `supports_reasoning: true` but don't include `reasoning_effort` in their `supported_openai_params` no longer show the effort picker (previously caused rejected requests and retry loops). The `reasoning_effort` parameter is now properly gated behind `isParameterSupported` checks in request builders.
* **"none" effort handling fixed**: When reasoning effort falls through to `"none"` as a fallback value, the field is now omitted from the request entirely rather than setting it to `"none"` (which was also rejected by some backends).
* **Reasoning content support**: Stream interpreter now correctly handles `delta.reasoning_content` from chat-completions responses (used by Qwen3, llama.cpp, and other models that emit reasoning via this field).
* **Merge reasoning content flag**: Added `merge_reasoning_content_in_choices` flag to control whether `reasoning_content` is emitted as separate thinking parts or merged into content for compatibility.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-10

### 💥 Breaking / Behavior Changes — READ BEFORE UPGRADING

> ⚠️ **Configuration has fundamentally changed in this release.** If you were using the old workspace-settings approach (`litellm-connector.baseUrl`, `litellm-connector.backends`, `litellm-connector.apiKey`), those settings are **gone**. The extension now uses VS Code's built-in **Language Models provider-group** UI (VS Code 1.120+) as the sole configuration path.
>
> **What to do if things go sideways after upgrading:**
> 1. Run **`LiteLLM: Reset All Configuration`** from the Command Palette to clear any stale state.
> 2. Open VS Code's **Language Models** settings panel (Settings → Language Models, or via `LiteLLM: Manage Configuration`).
> 3. Add a new LiteLLM provider group with your base URL and API key.
> 4. If you had multiple backends, add one provider group per backend.
> 5. After saving, wait a moment for model discovery to complete, or run **`LiteLLM: Reload Models`**.
>
> **The automatic migration** runs on first activation and attempts to move your old secrets/settings into the new provider-group format via a guided notification. If that prompt is dismissed or fails, follow the manual steps above.

* **Removed Legacy Workspace-Settings Configuration**: The `litellm-connector.baseUrl`, `litellm-connector.backends`, and `litellm-connector.apiKeySecretRef` workspace settings have been removed. Configuration now comes exclusively from VS Code 1.120+ per-group provider configuration via the `languageModelChatProviders` contribution point.
* **Removed `litellm-connector.checkConnection` command** and its menu entries. Use `LiteLLM: Reload Models` to verify discovery is working.
* **Removed Legacy ConfigManager Methods**: `setConfig()`, `addBackend()`, `removeBackend()`, `updateBackend()`, `listBackends()`, `isConfigured()`, `cleanupAllConfiguration()`, and `resolveBackends()` have been removed from `ConfigManager`.
* **Removed Legacy Type Fields**: `LiteLLMConfig.url`, `.key`, and `.backends` fields have been removed. The `LiteLLMBackend` and `ResolvedBackend` interfaces have been deleted.
* **Git commit generation and inline completions now require `commitModelIdOverride`** to be set explicitly in settings. They no longer auto-detect a model. The previous 2.0.0 temporary limitation is now codified as the permanent behavior.

### ✨ Features

* **Automatic Legacy Config Migration**: On first activation after upgrading, the extension detects old workspace-settings / `SecretStorage` configurations and shows a guided notification to help you migrate to the new provider-group format. Migration state is tracked so the prompt only appears once. (`src/config/legacyConfigMigration.ts`)
* **Per-Group Isolation**: Each configured provider group gets its own model discovery state. Multiple LiteLLM backends no longer share or bleed state between groups.
* **Model Override Master Toggle** (`litellm-connector.enableModelOverrides`): A new boolean setting lets you disable all override rules and rely purely on `/model/info` from the LiteLLM proxy. Useful when proxy-reported capabilities are accurate.
* **Tool Name Sanitization for Bedrock**: Tool names are automatically sanitized for Bedrock-compatible providers that reject non-alphanumeric characters.
* **Tool Call ID Normalization**: Tool call IDs are normalized to ≤40 characters for strict providers (e.g., GPT-5 / o-series).
* **Image & PDF Token Estimation**: Token budget calculation now estimates tokens consumed by image and PDF data parts (closes #76).
* **Discovery Backoff**: Repeated model discovery failures now trigger an exponential backoff to prevent hammering a proxy that is down.
* **Structured Logging Guidance**: `StructuredLogger` now has a documented per-level decision table so log noise is consistent and predictable.
* **Audit Trail / Prompt Audit Tooling**: Added hook system for observability, including a PostHog hook and an audit trail for prompt and response inspection.

### 🛠️ Refactors

* **BackendRegistry Owns Discovery**: `ModelDiscovery` has been merged into `LiteLLMProviderRegistry`. The registry is now the single source of truth for backends and their associated models, with a **public read, internal write** contract. `discoverModels(options, token)` is the only public ingress for populating the registry; internal write methods are now `private`. The base provider subscribes to the registry's `onDidChange` event and forwards to VS Code's `onDidChangeLanguageModelChatInformation`.
* **Provider Base Split**: The provider base was split into dedicated discovery, request, and transport service layers under `src/providers/base/` for clearer single-responsibility boundaries.
* **Streaming Interpreter Unified**: `/responses` stream event handling has been migrated into the shared `LiteLLMStreamInterpreter` so both the chat provider and responses adapter share one stream-parsing path.
* **TypeScript Strict Typing**: Broad `any` elimination pass across adapters, config, providers, and tests. All new code conforms to the `typescript-no-any` rule.

### 🐛 Fixes

* **Streaming abort on cancellation**: Streaming requests are now correctly aborted when the user cancels or the inactivity timeout fires.
* **Reasoning effort preserved across refreshes**: Selected reasoning effort is no longer reset when model discovery refreshes the picker.
* **Sparse tool capability detection fixed**: Models with partial tool-capability indicators are now detected correctly.
* **Provider group names derived from base URLs**: When no explicit name is provided, provider group labels are derived from the base URL for clearer picker display.

### 📊 Telemetry & Observability

* **Centralized streaming token capture**: Token usage is captured in one place across the streaming path and reported consistently.
* **Enriched token usage reporting**: Input, output, and reserved output budgets are all reported in telemetry events.
* **Commit generation routing telemetry**: Token usage and routing decisions during commit message generation are now captured.
* **Tokenizer observability**: Tokenizer selection and fallback events are logged for diagnosability.

### 🧪 Tests

* Broadened coverage across streaming, observability, and activation flows.
* Expanded `messageConverter` coverage.
* Refactored transport tests for clarity and improved configuration handling coverage.

### 🧭 Migration Guide (Legacy → 2.1.0)

If you were using any of the following **old workspace settings**, they no longer exist:

| Old Setting | Action |
|---|---|
| `litellm-connector.baseUrl` | Add a provider group in the Language Models UI |
| `litellm-connector.backends` | Add one provider group per backend |
| `litellm-connector.apiKey` / `apiKeySecretRef` | Enter API key when adding a provider group |

**Step-by-step:**
1. After upgrading, watch for the **migration notification** on startup — it will guide you through re-entering your backends.
2. If you dismiss it or need to redo it: open **Command Palette** → **`LiteLLM: Manage Configuration`** → follow prompts.
3. If you get stuck: **`LiteLLM: Reset All Configuration`** clears everything so you can start fresh.
4. Verify with **`LiteLLM: Reload Models`** — your models should appear in the picker grouped by backend name.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-05-14

### 🧭 Improvements

* **Modern Provider-Group Config**: The extension now detects VS Code per-group provider configuration during model discovery and treats it as the preferred configuration path.
* **Legacy Prompt Suppression**: Once modern provider configuration is validated, the extension suppresses legacy configuration prompts for the rest of the session.
* **Model Picker Grouping**: Discovered models now carry backend category metadata so multi-backend groups stay visually separated in the picker.

### 📊 Telemetry & Validation

* **Configuration-Flow Telemetry Refresh**: Added telemetry hooks around modern configuration detection so activation and discovery flows can be tracked more accurately.
* **Regression Coverage**: Added and updated tests for provider discovery, telemetry behavior, and extension activation/integration paths.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-13

### 💥 Breaking / Behavior Changes

* **VS Code 1.120+ Baseline**: The extension now targets the VS Code 1.120 Language Model provider surface as the primary path for model discovery and response-part handling.
* **Modern Provider Config First**: Discovery now prioritizes per-group provider configuration (`options.configuration`) and only falls back to extension-managed backends when provider configuration is missing/incomplete. This modern provider-group path is the preferred configuration path for full VS Code feature alignment.
* **Provider Config Validation Tightened**: Provider-group conversion now requires a non-empty provider/group name, `baseUrl` starting with `http://` or `https://`, and a non-empty `apiKey`.
* **Manage Command Behavior Changed**: `litellm-connector.manage` now routes directly to multi-backend management instead of prompting a legacy single-backend setup flow.

### ✨ Features

* **Unified Chat Provider Path**: Consolidated chat behavior around the VS Code 1.120 rich response-part flow (text/thinking/data/tool-call emission path hardening and shared orchestration improvements).
* **Modern Grouped Discovery**: Added and expanded session-based discovery primitives (`BackendSession`) so model identities and picker grouping remain isolated by configured provider/group.
* **Auto-Refresh After Config Changes**: Added a debounced `workspace.onDidChangeConfiguration` refresh hook that clears the model cache so Language Models UI updates after configuration changes.
* **Reasoning Overrides + Fallbacks**: Added regex-based reasoning capability overrides and retry/fallback behavior for reasoning-effort handling.
* **Model Override Registry**: Added `src/config/modelOverrides.ts` + `modelOverrides.json` with test coverage for structured override loading.

### 🛠️ Fixes & Refactors

* **Runtime Guard Hardening**: Tightened runtime checks across clients/providers/telemetry and removed unsafe cast-heavy paths.
* **Discovery Flow Cleanup**: Refactored provider-base discovery into clearer modern-session and backend-fallback branches.
* **Command/UI Reliability**: Improved backend-management UX details (focus behavior, trimmed inputs, command copy) and aligned activation prompts to configuration management flow.
* **Type Safety Improvements**: Broader strict typing cleanup across adapters, config, providers, utility helpers, and tests.

### 🧪 Tests & Validation

* Expanded regression and unit coverage across:
  * provider discovery/grouping/model-display behavior
  * extension activation/configuration refresh behavior
  * config conversion/validation and model override resolution
  * responses/message conversion and token/capability handling

### 📚 Documentation

* Updated both README variants to align setup guidance with modern provider-group behavior, backend identity grouping, and updated command semantics.

### ⚠️ Known Risks / Follow-ups

* **Broad Refresh Trigger Scope**: The config-change refresh hook currently reacts to all workspace configuration changes; it may refresh more often than necessary and could be narrowed to relevant keys later.
* **Temporary Feature Limitation (2.0.0)**: Unless manually configured, **git commit message generation** and **inline completions** may be inoperative in this release while modern-config parity work is completed.
* **Modern-Only Parity Audit Pending**: Commit-message and inline-completion paths still have legacy/fallback touchpoints; validate strict modern-only configuration parity before declaring migration complete.
* **No-Auth Proxy UX**: Modern provider validation now requires `apiKey`; environments that intentionally run without auth may need an explicit UX strategy if this should remain supported.

## [1.6.3] - 2026-04-30

### 🐛 Fixes

* **Cache Control Handling**: Suppressed `cache_control` data parts at the VS Code streaming boundary and nested tool-result conversion paths, preventing `application/vnd.cache-control+json` carrier objects from being re-emitted into future LLM input while preserving legitimate text mentions for debugging and code generation.

### 🧪 Tests

* Replaced the streaming regression test that previously codified cache-control carrier pass-through with suppression coverage, plus guards for non-cache-control data parts and tool-result metadata stripping.

## [1.6.2] - 2026-04-28

### ✨ Features

* **V2 Responses Pipeline**: Overhauled the V2 responses conversion and validation to handle `LanguageModelDataPart`, `LanguageModelThinkingPart`, and other VS Code internal carrier objects properly.

### 🐛 Fixes

* **Streaming Error Logging**: Improved streaming error logging and telemetry to capture more granular details on connection drops and parse failures.
* **Cache Control Handling**: Dropped `cache_control` metadata from transport and token counting to prevent `{"$mid":24,"mimeType":"cache_control","data":"ZXBoZW1lcmFs"}` carrier objects from corrupting prompts or inflating the token budget.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-04-23

### ✨ Features

* **Model Display Labels**: Added `ExtendedModelInformation` type and `formatModelDisplayLabel` helper to centralize model UI labeling and vendor display.
* **Provider Metadata**: Updated `LiteLLMProviderBase` to expose `rawModelName`, `vendor`, `backendName`, `tooltip` and `detail` so consumers render consistent model info.
* **Token Normalization**: Normalized provider handling and token fields by using `providerLower` for family derivation and `derived.maxInputTokens` for maxInputTokens.

### 🐛 Fixes

* **Post-Session Scripts**: Updated post-session validation message to recommend running `npm run format` and `npm run lint` (removed `:check` variants) so commands match current scripts.

### 🧹 Chores & Tests

* Bumped package.json version to 1.6.1-dev5.
* Adjusted unit tests to validate new display label formatting and backendName/description values.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-12

### 🎊 New Features

* 🌍 **Multi-Backend Aggregation**: Connect to multiple LiteLLM instances simultaneously (e.g., Local Llama + Cloud GPT-4 + Internal Proxy). Models from different backends are automatically namespaced (e.g., `cloud/gpt-4o`, `local/llama-3`) and appear in the model picker with clear backend labels.
  - New `MultiBackendClient` adapter handles routing, discovery, and request dispatch across backends.
  - New `litellm-connector.backends` configuration setting with full add/edit/remove/toggle UI via **Manage Multiple Backends** command.
  - Legacy single-backend configuration (`baseUrl`/`apiKey`) auto-migrates to `backends[0]` transparently.

* 📊 **PostHog Telemetry & Observability**: Non-identifiable data collection with opt-in/opt-out via `vscode.env.isTelemetryEnabled`.
  - `TelemetryService` with typed capture methods for request lifecycle, feature usage, errors, and model usage.
  - `PostHogAdapter` (Node) and `PostHogAdapter` (Web) implementing `IPostHogAdapter` interface.
  - `PostHogHook` bridges the v2 observability `HookSystem` to PostHog telemetry events.
  - Automatic enrichment of every event with `distinctId`, `extension_version`, `vscode_version`, `ui_kind`, `os`.
  - Aggregated feature usage reporting on 15-minute intervals to reduce noise.
  - Sourcemap upload script for PostHog error symbolication.

* 🔧 **Model Capability Overrides**: Manually override VS Code's capability detection (`toolCalling`, `imageInput`) when LiteLLM's auto-detection is incorrect. Configure via `litellm-connector.modelCapabilitiesOverrides` setting with comma-separated values (e.g., `"toolCalling, imageInput"` or `"tools, vision"`).

* 🧠 **V2 Chat Provider (Experimental)**: Supports VS Code's newer Language Model APIs including `LanguageModelThinkingPart` for reasoning/thinking models. Emits structured text, thinking, data, and tool-call parts to the progress callback.

* ✍️ **Multi-Repo Commit Message Generation**: `generateCommitMessage` command now correctly identifies the active repository via SCM `rootUri`. Works reliably in multi-repo workspaces.
  - Added `rootUri` to `Repository` interface in `GitUtils`.
  - Added `findRepositoryByRootUri` to `GitUtils` for precise repository matching.
  - Updated `generateCommitMessage` command to use the correct repository for both diff retrieval and input box updates.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

* 🛠️ Keep commit-message generation failures visible in both local logs and telemetry.
* 🧭 Propagate request IDs through PostHog request telemetry for better event correlation.
* ⚙️ Fixed undefined silent flag which blocked the ability to configure litellm as a new instance.
* 🛠️ Fixed issues with the nuke command leaving stale models behind when resetting user configuration.
* 🛠️ Stabilized telemetry ID and re-scoped unhandled exception detection and handling to be properly aligned with best practices.

### 📊 Telemetry & Observability

* 🛠️ Add telemetry feature-usage reporting for chat, completions, inline completions, commit generation, and model picker usage.
* 🔔 Capture feature toggle snapshots and toggle-change events from config changes so opt-in behavior is visible in telemetry.
* 🧭 Extend telemetry exception capture with caller context and add tests for the new feature-usage events.

### 🧩 Configuration & Commands

* ⚙️ `ConfigManager` now reports feature-toggle state after config changes.
* 🚦 Telemetry wired into model-management and reset/check commands for consistent tracking.
* 📝 Feature-usage snapshot emitted during extension activation after configuration loads.
* New `litellm-connector.backends` setting for multi-backend configuration (array of `{name, url, apiKeySecretRef, enabled}`).
* New `litellm-connector.modelCapabilitiesOverrides` setting for per-model capability overrides.

### 🧪 Testing & Validation

* ✅ Multi-repo regression tests for `GitUtils` and `generateCommitMessage` command.
* ✅ `MultiBackendClient`, `ResponsesAdapter`, `TokenUtils`, `ConfigManager`, and telemetry service test coverage.
* ✅ PostHog adapter tests for both Node and Web, including disabled/pre-initialize paths.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-28

### 📢 Important Repo Update Notice
With this release, we have also updated the repository URL and cleared git commit history to clear up any potential confusion. The previous repository will be archived for the foreseeable future for transparency and to serve as a data point for references if needed.

There have been a tremendous amount of backend work done with this update to make it easier for issue reporting, building, etc.

### 🐛 Fixes
- Fixed a bug with issues switching between `chat/completion` and `/response` endpoints. Previously if you were using an endpoint that used one or other other; switching would often result in failure. This should be resolve with this update now.
- Fixed a bug with switching models during a chat interaction with tool calls. Occasionally it was observed that tool calls would not transfer / update appropriately when switching models.
- Added loop prevention logic during AI Actions in agentic mode. It was observed, that under some conditions the model would begin looping requesting the same data points over and over again not moving off of that process. We've implemented logic to detect this scenario and attempt to break out of it after the 3rd iteration.
